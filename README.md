# κρῐτῐκός - automating the OCR of critical editions of pre-modern texts

The global corpus of pre-modern texts is small when compared with modern corpora, and notwithstanding the occasional discovery does not grow. 

The state of the art of natural-language processing is data-hungry machine learning techniques. 
Hence, if research in low-resource languages like Ancient Greek, Latin, Old English, Pali, Sanskrit and Classical Chinese is to be able to leverage these tools long-term, a strategy for maximizing the data inherent in the small corpus must be adopted.
